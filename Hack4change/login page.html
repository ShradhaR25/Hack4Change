<h1>Precautions for pregnant women while doing Yoga<br>
During the advanced stages of pregnancy, avoid yoga asanas that put pressure on the abdomen.
<br>For the first trimester of pregnancy, do standing yoga poses. This will help strengthen the legs and enhance circulation. It can even reduce leg cramps.
<br>During the second and third trimester, reduce the time spent holding asanas to prevent fatigue. 
<br>Substitute with breathing exercises and meditation.
Avoid practicing yoga from the 10th to the 14th week of pregnancy since these are crucial times.
<br>Avoid doing inversion poses.
Listen to your body and do as much as you can without undue effort.
